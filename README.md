# 100daysofcode
i have started 100 days of code in python and today was day 7.
this repository is the day 7 project called a hangman game, which if you don't know about , head over to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game) to have a look at it.
I personally like this game and enjoyed writing the code for it.
